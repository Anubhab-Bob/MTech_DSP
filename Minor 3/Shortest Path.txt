Write a C program to compute shortest path between two given nodes for an unweighted undirected connected graph.

You should implement the following:

1. Implement forward star graph representation

2. Use bfs to compute the shortest path (you should use the forward star representation that you have implemented in the BFS)

3. Write a test function which reads number of vertices, number of edges, the sequence of edges followed by source and destination vertices from stdin.

Sample Input/Output: (for K4 - complete graph on 4 vertices, vertex index starts from 0)

Input: 4 6 0 1 0 2 0 3 1 0 1 2 1 3 2 0 2 1 2 3 3 0 3 1 3 2 0 3

Output: 1

You should print "INVALID INPUT" for all invalid input cases.
